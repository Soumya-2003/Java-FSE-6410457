## Implementing Dependency Injection
This exercise focuses on implementing Dependency Injection (DI) using Springâ€™s Inversion of Control (IoC) container. 
It will ensure that the BookService class receives a BookRepository instance via DI, and verify it works correctly.

### ðŸ§¾ Overview
- Used setter injection to wire BookRepository into BookService.
- Configured dependencies in applicationContext.xml.
- Verified dependency injection by running the Spring application.
