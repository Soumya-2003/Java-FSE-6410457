## ðŸ“š JUnit Exercise 4: AAA Pattern, Test Fixtures, Setup & Teardown
This project demonstrates how to write unit tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern in JUnit 4 , along with the use of setup and teardown 
methods (@Before and @After) to manage test fixtures.

### ðŸ§  Explanation of AAA Pattern and Fixtures
* Arrange:- Set up the test environment (e.g., initialize objects).
* Act:- Perform the action under test (e.g., call a method).
* Assert:- Verify the expected outcome (e.g., check results).
* @Before:- Runs before each test method (used for initialization).
* @After:- Runs after each test method (used for cleanup).
