## Exercise: Mocking and Stubbing with Mockito
We need to test a service that depends on an external API. Use Mockito to mock the external API and stub its methods to return predefined values.

* Created a mock object for an external API using Mockito .
* Stubbed the API method to return a predefined value.
* Written a test case that uses the mock object to verify the behavior of your service.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Mocking:- Creating fake objects to simulate real dependencies.
- Stubbing:- Configuring a mock to return specific values for method calls.
- JUnit 5:- A modern unit testing framework for Java.
- Mockito:- A popular mocking framework for Java.
