## Flight Ticket Booking App

A simple React application demonstrating **conditional rendering**, **state management**, and **user authentication flow** through a flight ticket booking interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

This hands-on lab application demonstrates:
- Conditional rendering in React
- Using element variables and components
- Preventing components from rendering based on conditions
- Managing user login/logout state
- Creating a dynamic UI for guest vs. logged-in users

## ðŸ§© Features

- **Guest View**: Browse available flights (no booking allowed)
- **User View**: Logged-in users can view flights and book tickets
- **Login/Logout Toggle**: Button dynamically changes based on authentication state
- **Conditional Rendering**: Different content shown based on `isLoggedIn` state
- **Reusable Components**: `FlightCard` component for consistent flight display

## SCREENSHOT OF THE OUTPUT

On launch, youâ€™ll see the Guest Page with flight details and a Login button.
