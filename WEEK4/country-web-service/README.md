### üìö SME Notes

- What happens in the controller method?

  The getCountryIndia() method is mapped to /country and returns a Country object. Spring automatically serializes it to JSON.

- How is the bean converted into JSON?

  Spring Boot uses the Jackson library to serialize Java objects to JSON automatically.
